### Description 

Tap water distribution service using two new objects: the paper bottle and the trolley.
Runners go to the city's many partner bars to collect tap water. This water is taken directly from the facility's tap, filtered and then redistributed to program subscribers.
This local service is intended to recreate social ties and reduce the ecological impact of water bottles that bloom in cities during hot weather.

### Distributing

Eau Courante's runners go to the city squares to distribute fresh tap water to all subscribers of the programme.
They also give paper bottles to people who want to support this program.

### Moving

The trolleys that the runners pull seem to levitate: Teflon-coated half-spheres are attached to the base of the hull.
This material prevents the trolley from rubbing on the city's various floor coverings (gravel, paving stones, bitumen, sand, earth, etc.)

### Coming forward 

The goal of the program is to provide the public with prevention services. Water is a common good and tap water is a major issue for our society and our future.
The runners in the program are easily recognizable by their uniforms.
